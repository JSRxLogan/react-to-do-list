A full-featured, responsive To-Do list app built with React, Redux Toolkit, and Tailwind CSS. This is the refined and upgraded version of my first JavaScript to-do list project—now with category-based planning (Daily, Weekly, Monthly, Yearly) and clean, modern UI/UX. 


## 🚀 Features
- Task categorization: Daily, Weekly, Monthly, Yearly
- Add, delete, and complete tasks
- Category toggling using a shared state (not router)
- Persistent task state using Redux Toolkit
- Looping through and rendering each task as a separate component
- Responsive UI with TailwindCSS
- Clean and organized folder/component structure

## 🔧 Tech Stack
- React
- Redux Toolkit (RTK)
- TailwindCSS
- GitHub Pages for deployment

## 💡 Concepts Used
- `useState`, `useDispatch`, `useSelector`
- Redux slices and global state management
- Rendering to-do items via `.map()` into individual components
- State-driven category switching (not using react-router)
- Utility-first styling with Tailwind
- Deployed with GitHub Pages

## 🧠 What I Learned
- Building scalable components
- Using Redux Toolkit to manage state cleanly
- Rendering lists efficiently via `.map()`
- Maintaining structure and styling using TailwindCSS
- Thinking in a component-first, state-driven way

## 🛤️ My Journey
About 4 months ago, I started building a to-do app with the goal of organizing tasks into **Daily, Weekly, Monthly, and Yearly** sections. The idea was solid, but my JS skills at the time weren’t ready for full implementation.

After completing my React, Redux Toolkit, and TailwindCSS training, I came back with a mission to finish what I started—and this time, I used the right methods:
- 🔁 Tasks are no longer appended using DOM tricks. Instead, they are **looped and rendered cleanly using React components.**
- 🔄 Category switching is handled through **state**, not router logic.
- 🌟 The app is now structured, scalable, and future-ready.
